<p class=portfolio-para>Currently I am studying at Coder Academy in the Full Stack Web Developer course as well as working as a chef which I have been doing for the past 25 years.  I'd like to use the skills I gain here to develop pages and apps to support the hospitality industry with food allergies and sustainability sources. Food has been my passion from sourcing sustainable ingredients, and being able to support people with allergies. I've found so much conflicting information or not enough information about resources that can help and support the hospitality industry in an easy one stop location.
    I consider attending coder academy a new opportunity to give back.
